1.
I didn't get to working on the system calls for this project.

2a.
I manage the disk by using the pointers to read and write from the disk.

2b. 
For file allocation, I check the file size to see which type of header (direct, indirect, or double) is needed. Then based on that, I make a pointer for each sector of the type that is needed.

2c.
I didn't complete this part of the project.

2d. 
I did not use any data structures for this part of the project.

3.
I didn't finish Task 1 and didn't get to start Task 2 or 3. This is because I've been focusing on other projects for both this class and other classes. 

4.
For the part of the project that I did work on, I did not use any data structures because it was not needed.

5.
I didn't use any inherent algorithms because for the code that I did do, I didn't notice any algorithms that would be useful.
